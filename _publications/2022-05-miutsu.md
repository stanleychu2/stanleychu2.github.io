This paper introduces Miutsu, National Taiwan University’s Alexa Prize TaskBot, which is designed to assist users in completing tasks requiring multiple steps and decisions in two different domains – home improvement and cooking. We overview our system design and architectural goals, and detail the proposed core elements, including question answering, task retrieval, social chatting, and various conver- sational modules. A dialogue flow is proposed to provide a robust and engaging conversation when handling complex tasks. We discuss the faced challenges during the competition and potential future work.
